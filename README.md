# Simsbury Bank Mortgage Alerts

This script accesses a url from Simsbury Bank with a redirect to a pdf file. It then parses the pdf file and extracts the current 30 Fixed interest rate. Finally, it pushes the rate as a note via pushbullet. I have set this to execute on a schedule using Windows Task Scheduler.
